"""Provide several sample math calculations.

This module allows the user to make mathematical calculations.

The module contains the following functions:

- `add(a, b)` - Returns the sum of two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` - Returns the difference of two numbers.
- `multiply(a, b)` - Returns the product of two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` - Returns the quotient of two numbers.
